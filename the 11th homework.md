# The motion equation and trajectories of objects under inverse-square law along with two-body problem and modification of law of gravitation by general relativity  
-exercise 4.7 and 4.11  
##Abstract  
###Background  
Whatever the equation of force has the factor one over r square
(r stands for the distance between object inflicted by the force and the field source) is called the inverse-square law in Physics,
the law of universal gravitation, for example, is one of them. Using the law of gravitation and Newton's laws of motion, we can
easily get the equations and trajectories of planets in solar system theoretically.  
In the exercises, we will try to solve some problems of celestial body using numerical simulation.
